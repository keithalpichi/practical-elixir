## Modifying exercises or creating new ones
---
The top of the exercise file must have the following as comments:
- `Learning Outcomes`- bulleted points of what the user should learn from implementing the module and functions in the file from specific to general.
- `Restrictions`- anything the user should avoid doing. This is usually to help the user implement the functions in a module in a different way while supporting the learning outcomes. For example, a user could be told not to use the `reduce` function and instead be encouraged to use recursion instead.
- `Resources`- any external links, comments, notes that may point the user in the right direction without giving them the whole solution.
